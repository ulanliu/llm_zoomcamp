Some parquet files for green data have records with decimals in ehail_fee column.\\nThere are some possible fixes:\\nDrop ehail_feel column since it is not really used. For instance when creating a partitioned table from the external table in BigQuery\\nSELECT * EXCEPT (ehail_fee) FROM…\\nModify stg_green_tripdata.sql model using this line cast(0 as numeric) as ehail_fee.\\nModify Airflow dag to make the conversion and avoid the error.\\npv.read_csv(src_file, convert_options=pv.ConvertOptions(column_types = {\\'ehail_fee\\': \\'float64\\'}))\\nSame type of ERROR - parquet files with different data types - Fix it with pandas\\nHere is another possibility that could be interesting:\\nYou can specify the dtypes when importing the file from csv to a dataframe with pandas\\npd.from_csv(..., dtype=type_dict)\\nOne obstacle is that the regular int64 pandas use (I think this is from the numpy library) does not accept null values (NaN, not a number). But you can use the pandas Int64 instead, notice capital ‘I’. The type_dict is a python dictionary mapping the column names to the dtypes.\\nSources:\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html\\nNullable integer data type — pandas 1.5.3 documentation',\n",

IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters\\nAs the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS\\n2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:\\nimport pyspark\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:\\nconf = SparkConf() \\\\\\n.setMaster(\\'local[*]\\') \\\\\\n.setAppName(\\'test\\') \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.jars\", \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl\",  \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.impl\", \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\")\\n5.) Once you run that, build your SparkSession with the new parameters we’d just instantiated in the previous step:\\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\\\\n.config(conf=sc.getConf()) \\\\\\n.getOrCreate()\\n6.)

The suitable type would be StringType. Spark  inferSchema is more accurate than Pandas infer type method in this case.
